Developed my own Sudoku program in Qt using C++ as one of my first-year Advanced Programming tasks.

Developed my own sum algorithm to verify its correctness. 
The interface uses up and down buttons to change numbers and a star to indicate numbers that cannot be changed. 
It also includes a button to open a game file and a “check” button to validate the result.

Please note that the Sudoku window may not fit properly depending on the device’s screen.

For more step-by-step information on the process of making this project, please look at Sudoku_Logbook1 and Sudoku_Logbook2 folders.
