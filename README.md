Made my own QT Sudoku using C++ as my first year Advanced Programming task.

Developed my own sum algorithm to verify its correctness. 
The interface uses up and down buttons to change numbers and a star to indicate numbers that cannot be changed. 
It also includes a button to open a game file and a “check” button to validate the result.

Please note that the Sudoku window does not fit on some screens.
Try playing on a Raspberry Pi 4.
